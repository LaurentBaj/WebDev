It takes three seconds for a user to judge a webpage's design 



COLOUR THEORY	
	-Different colours convey different messages 
		-Red: love, energy, intensity
		-Yellow: Attention grabbing - works great for a short period but can be distracting and annoying after a while 
		-Green: Freshness, growth, safety 
		-Blue: Stability, trust, serenity
		-Purple: Royalty, wealth, femininity 
	
	Analogous Colours
		-When choosing colours for a website, going for two colours that almost look the same on the colour pallet is a wise choice 	
			-Works well together - looks harmonious
				-Nav-bar, body, logo and it's background 

	Complementary colours
		-Choosing two colors that are (in some way) the opposite of each other
			-Works well when you want something to stand out
				ex- Red meat isle using green dividers between each product. Makes the red meat stand out (makes it look even more red)
