An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set
of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers 
can use to create software or interact with an external system 
    - Examples: weather, shared friends(tinder's facebook API)  

ENDPOINT - Contains the URL of a server. Browsers use a GET-request to traverse to a domain. 

PATH - A server might have different pages/routes. An endpoint can have variations: facebook/home || facebook/friends

PARAMETERS - Allows me to narrow my querries. At the end of the endpoint. Comes after a question mark and have one ampersand between them. 
Tinder does not gives heterosexual men options to match with other men since the queries narrow it down to women. 
It can also take age in to consideration. So the query contains two parameters: gender and age
