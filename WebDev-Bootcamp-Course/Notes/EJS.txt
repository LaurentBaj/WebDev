EJS - EMBEDDED JAVASCRIPT TEMPLATING 

To use EJS: app.set("view engine", "ejs"); 

Express will always search for a folder called view and a file inside it called index.ejs
The index.ejs file inside view exists paralell to the index.html file on the work folder 
The index.ejs has the same contents inside it as the html exept from the ejs template markers 

EJS Template Marker(inside index.ejs): <h1> Today is <%= variableName  %>   </h1>
	In JS:     res.render("list", {variableName: today}); 

index.ejx does also allow js code as long as each line (of js code) is sorrounded by <% %>

	 <% if(kindOfDay === "Saturday" || kindOfDay === "Sunday") { %>
        	<h1 style="color: rebeccapurple;"><%= kindOfDay %>!</h1>
    	<% } else { %>
        	<h1 style="color: blue"><%= kindOfDay %>!</h1>
    	<% } %>
