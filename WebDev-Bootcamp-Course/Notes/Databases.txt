REPETITION ON DATABASES 


TWO MAIN TYPES

SQL - STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE: MySQL, PostgreSQL
NoSQL - NOT ONLY STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE: mongoDB, redis

SQL: Most Common. Inflexible: Fills empty tables with NULL (which is problematic). FAST. - RELATIONAL
NoSQL: Structured in JSON-Objects. Flexible. -NON-RELATIONAL





WHICH ONE SHOULD I USE? 

	- Complex Relationships: SQL 
	- Single users generating lots of (the same type of) content: NoSQL
	- Scalability: NoSQL

MAINFRAMES - What I thought was supercomputers. Used for large enterprise storage.

MongoDB - Organizes data into smaller docs of data. Allows for my data to be stored onto different computers. Scalable. 




PROS AND CONS 


MySQL: More mature, table structure, requires a schema (before building it), faster with relationships, scales vertically(costly)

MongoDB: Shiny and New, document structure, flexible to change, slower with relationships, scales horisontaly(less expensive)






- S Q L - 

CRUD - CREATE - READ - UPDATE - DESTROY

1) CREATE

CREATE TABLE - Create Table tableName (
				id INT,
				name STRING, 
				price MONEY,
				PRIMARY KEY (id)
				); 



INSERT ROWS -  INSERT INTO tableName (column1)
	       VALUES (1, "Pen", 1.2); 


2) READ 

Show everything in tableName: SELECT ** FROM 'tableName'; 
Reading one row: SELECT * tableName FROM WHERE id=1


3) UPDATE 

Change values: UPDATE tableName
	       SET price = 0.8
	       WHERE id=2; 


Adding columns:  ALTER TABLE tableName 
	         ADD stock INT // A new column is created but the values are NULL 


		// Adding values to the new columns (32, 12)
		UPDATE tableName
		SET stock = 32
		WHERE id=1

		UPDATE tableName
		SET stock = 12 
		WHERE id=2 


4) DEStROY 

Delete second row:  DELETE FROM tableName
		    WHERE id=2

Adding it back: INSERT INTO tableName
		VALUES (2, Pencil, 0.8, 12)




 - SQL RELATIONSHIPS, FOREIGN KEYS and INNER JOINS -

Foreign Key: Links tables together. Establish relationship 

JOINS: Read data from different tables. Different kinds of joins.
