REPETITION ON GIT AND GITHUB


Three stages: 

	- Working Dir: The actual files that are being worked on 
	- Staging Area: Sometimes it is not necessary to commit all files and the staging area allows us to be more specific about what we want to commit. 
	- Local Repo: The version of the files are stored in the .git repo (which is hidden unless: ls -a) and we can always checkout back to it (rollback). 


Files that are not added are known as untracked files and appear red when writing "git status" in terminal. 
Files that are tracked are added to the staging area where they can be commited. These appear in red when writing "git status" in terminal.

Rollback - Means to revert to the last version 
git checkout fileName: performs a rollback if the changes are not staged 

git rm --cached -r .     - Removes all tracked files from the staging area rendering them untracked


GITIGNORE
A "hidden" folder (not hidden from terminal) where I can store files about the project that contain classified data.
Each file must have it's on line of space in the document. 
When files are added then we can see that all the files + .gitignore are ready to be commited exept from those that are written inside the .gitignore
Rules: 
	-#Comment
	-*.txt - all the files which have the .txt extension will be ignored
