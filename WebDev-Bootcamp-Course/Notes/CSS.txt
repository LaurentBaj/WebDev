/* New things I learned about CSS from Angela's course */


Difference between Id and class 
	-You can have many objects with the same class value and is very useful if you plan to alter all of them at once 
	-ID are unique and you can only have one of them

The Box model
	-Elements on a webpage have padding, border and margins that sorrounds them. These are powerful properties and they affect other elements that border to it
	-It is not neccesary to alter each side, in fact, sometimes you only need changing them (padding, margin, border) on specific sides 

Width: %
	-Instead of pixels. Handy because it applies to the size of the screen and is scalable
	-Also useful when using <p> because if you write i paragraph in them then they'll appear on one line. But with the width property you can ajust it
		-Instead of using <pre>

Font-size
	-Instead of pixels, use rem/em. On em = 16 pixels  

Align-center
	-Allows different objects to appear on the center

Line-height
	-The distance between the lines in text or any other element 

Browser-defaults
	-Sometimes an element may be treated with a fixed property even when they are not specified by the programmer
	-To fix this you have to zero out that property
