/* New things I learned about CSS from Angela's course */


Difference between Id and class 
	-You can have many objects with the same class value and is very useful if you plan to alter all of them at once 
	-ID are unique and you can only have one of them
	-Using IDs sparingly is useful because it can be refer to from the navbar

The Box model
	-Elements on a webpage have padding, border and margins that sorrounds them. These are powerful properties and they affect other elements that border to it
	-It is not neccesary to alter each side, in fact, sometimes you only need changing them (padding, margin, border) on specific sides 

Width: %
	-Instead of pixels. Handy because it applies to the size of the screen and is scalable
	-Also useful when using <p> because if you write i paragraph in them then they'll appear on one line. But with the width property you can ajust it
		-Instead of using <pre>

Font-size
	-Instead of pixels, use rem/em. On em = 16 pixels  

Align-center
	-Allows different objects to appear on the center

Line-height
	-The distance between the lines in text or any other element 

Browser-defaults
	-Sometimes an element may be treated with a fixed property even when they are not specified by the programmer
	-To fix this you have to zero out that property which disturbes the intended usage 

Positioning
	-Moving an element can push other elements if it crosses onto their space
		-Using the 'relative' position allows it to float above any element that it might be crossing without affecting their position on the page 
		-Horisontal centering: 	maring: 0 auto 0 auto;   Top and bottom are zero while right and left are what they need to be in order to be centered 
	-Absolute positioning means that the objects position is relative to it's parent element and not the body (the body could also be it's parent)

Margin values
	-One = all sides
	-two = top and bottom, left and right
	-three = top, left and right, bottom
	-four = clockwise

Horisontal Centering using margin
	-If given four values then the order of values go clock-wise: top - right - bottom - left

Z-index
	-Only work when position is not static (following)
	-It needs to be positioned (relative, static, fixed aso)
	-Elements without a z-index will always appear on top
		-html order matters: if two elements, the first one is on top and will appear in the background of the second element

Media Query
	- @media (condition) {
		normal css code
	}

Hierarchical Selectors
	-right to left (space between, no comma)

Combined Selectors
	-left to right (no space or comma)

Selector Priority
	1) HTML - internal (<h1 id="t" class = "t" style = "background-color: red">) 
	2) external - ID (#t)
	3) external - Class (.t)
	4) external - html (h1, p)
