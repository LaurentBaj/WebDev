NEW STUFF I LEARNED ABOUT COMMAND LINE INTERFACES


Hyper is a command-line interface built on HTML and CSS
Needs git bash. I also changed the configuration. 

Basic commands are like bash: 
	- cd 
	- cd .. 
	cd ~: removes entire file-path and takes you back to step one  
	- touch text1.txt
	- rm text1.txt 
	- rm * - removes everything 
	- Remove a directory: rm -r Laurent/

While writing: 	
	- Ctrl A - skip to beginning if line 
	- Ctrl E - skip to where the line ends 
	- Ctrl U - Delete the whole line 

Start file/program - start wordpad 
		- start wordpad index.html
