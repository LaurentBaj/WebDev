NEW STUFF I LEARNED ABOUT JS

Sclicing a string 
    - var name = "Laurent";
    - var slicedName = name.slice(2-6); 
    -slicedName = "auren";   

Event listener
    variable/array.addEventListener("click", functionName); 
    - same as the .onclick method but require parameters
    - the parameters inside are: 1) Type("click") 2) anonymous function or called function
    - if am passing a function as a parameter it is important that it does not have parenthesis 
        -this is because it will execute upon runtime and not on an event such as a button 


High Order Functions
    -Parameterized function that can pass other funtions

Callback Functions
    - 

Debugger
    - The Inspector on a web page has a debugger functionality 
    - It goes through each line and describes its role
