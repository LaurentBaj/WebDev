New stuff I learned about HTML

Tables
	-Do not need borders and are as default without them 
	-To create rows: tr. To create columns inside td. To create header: th 
	-Inside a Table-bracket the convention to make the code more neat use:
		- thead, tbody and tfoote - brackets
	
	-Adjust space and create borders by setting cellspacing- and border value
	-Tables without border are usefull indenting DOM-elements like shown in "MyWebSide"
	
Emojis 
	-Click: Windos + . 

Forms 
	-Don't do anything themself but is a good convention to surround things like inputs and buttons in them
	-Attributes
		-name: Like the id-attribute, reads the value in the input
		-action: Upon submitting a form (by clicking a button) the user is sent to a given website
		-method: Specifies how to send form data upon clicking the submit
			-method = "POST": Sends data to server.
		-enctype: Specifies how the form-data is encrypted
			-enctype = "text/plain": Spaces are converted to "+" symbols, but no special characters are encoded 

Input Attributes
	-Text: Normal text-box
	-password: text is hidden
	-checkbox: clickable checkbox 
	-Submit: creates a button (default value = "Send")
	-Label: same as <p> but used in forms
	-Textarea: A larger are for inputing text. Size can be altered
	-email: textbox where legit email is required
	-color: A color button/pallete. Can choose a grading and provides the color value
